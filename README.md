# Discord-Bot-User-Role-Privilege-Escalation-PoC
A Discord Bot with the capabilities of elevating the users roles on any Discord Server it is on

---
 # IMPORTANT: 
 * THIS BOT IS A PROOF OF CONECPT, ONLY USE ON SERVERS YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO : DO NOT USE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES
 * DEVELOPER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE WITH BOT BY OTHERS

 # REQUIREMENTS:
 * node.js installed
 * discord.js npm packaged installed

 # HOW TO START:
 * Setup bot as an application on your discord developer portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
 * Create invite link using Discord's built in link generator and make sure the bot's permissions are set to only administrator 
 * Add bot to server
 * Run 'node .' in code to start bot
 
 * This bot is meant to be used as a privilege escalation tool for Discord servers
 * Bot can be customized to be used however is needed to maintain cover, though the default is the 'Funny Bot' cover 
 and customizing requires some discord.js knowledge
 * Commands can be added and removed for modularity, again, some discord.js knowledge is needed
 
 
 # NOTE:
 * I wrote part of this a while ago, so most of it is not using discord.js v14
 * Bot must be on the server for use
 * There are still a few bugs being worked with the '-create' and '-add' commands so expect a few issues
 * There is no multi-command handling so if more than one person tries to use a command at the same time nothing will happen for either of them.
 If needed on multiple servers it is recommened to host different instances of the bot
